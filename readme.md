### diff

This tool shows changes in a directory.
It also shows duplicated files and writes an archive.

It must be copied at the top level into the directory.
It is started by double-clicking `start.command`.
The current content is tracked in `node.yass`.

Precondition: a `JRE` must be installed

```
    myDir/
        diff/
            bin/
            lib/
            start.command
            node.yass
        mySubDir1/
            ...
        mySubDir2/
            ...
        ...   
        myFile1
        myFile2
        ... 
```
